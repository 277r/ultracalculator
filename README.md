# ultracalculator
a calculator i'm working on with a lot of 64 bit functions. this calculator includes functions like factorizing 3 term formulas. checking if x is a prime, and basic calculations like ^ / * +-. the calculations are using integers so if you want a decimal number you need to add a lot of zeros

!!!WARNING!!! this programming is so bad that i want to warn anyone here with a mind to not open any of these files, nor ever use this as an example. i will try rewriting this in a few weeks to make it better since it is currently just a steaming pile of horseshit
